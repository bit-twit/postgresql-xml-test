- try 2 POCs for different mappings of user/partners
	for users with custom fields per payload we need different entry for each partner
		1) add order_id as different property of User
			- you can have 
				1 User/1 order_id/no partner
				1 User/1 order_id/1 partner
				1 User/1 order_id/1 partner (more entries with same order_id)
				1 User/1 order_id/multiple partners
		2) try composite (order_id, partner_id) FK, each User is a new entry:
			- you can have
				1 User/1 order_id/1 partner
				1 User/1 order_id/1 partner (more entries with same order_id)
			- it means that for simple cases where you want just the same payload for multiple partners,
				you'll have to save a different record for each partner
			- is there the case where you don't have a partner_id ? it won't work for that

+ model PartnerIds and test export
	should be one partner export where partnerId = ?

+ add custom XML type that helps Hibernate map between String <-> PostgreSQL XML
    http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hibernate_XML_Type
+ see if we can use custom queries with JPA to retrieve data through PostgreSQL XPATH query
