- try 2 POCs for different mappings of user/partners
	(16:13:01) : but I was thinking about this partner id stuff
	(16:13:04) iplesoianu: yeah
	(16:13:12) : i think for campaigns where we have customer fields per partner
	(16:13:40) iplesoianu: hmm, like custom customer form fields ?
	(16:13:40) : we need to create separate lead entry in Iris for each partner
	(16:13:44) : yes
	(16:14:13) : because otherwise its probably hard to do the exports for each partner
	(16:14:16) iplesoianu: ah, yes it makes sense, you'll have different payloads
	(16:14:19) : yes
	(16:15:04) : partner a = general payload + custom fields for partner a
	partner b = general payload + custom fields for partner b
	and so on...
	(16:16:03) iplesoianu: hmm
	(16:16:15) iplesoianu: I think the problem would be at the id
	(16:16:16) : so probably we need prometheus to split the payload and to create sepearte lead entries for each partner
	(16:16:23) : yes, you've already told me
	(16:16:34) iplesoianu: forgot about it :D
	(16:16:36) iplesoianu: :))
	(16:16:53) : but can't we use a combined id using order id and partner id
	(16:16:58) : ?
	(16:17:03) iplesoianu: yeah, I should probably put back the lead_id and make all the tables connect on lead_id ?
	(16:17:09) iplesoianu: or like that 
	(16:17:10) iplesoianu: yeah
	(16:17:13) : or lead id
	(16:17:40) iplesoianu: on (order_id, parnter_id) FK
	(16:17:55) : yes...
	(16:18:04) iplesoianu: I'm not sure how it will work, for cases like right now, when we don't have different payloads
	(16:18:23) iplesoianu: so would have only one lead with a couple of same partners 
	(16:18:52) iplesoianu: with the second option it could work in both cases I guess
	(16:19:07) : whats the second option?
	(16:19:10) : lead id?
	(16:19:15) iplesoianu: you would just generate one or more lead_id entries, connected to one or more partner_ids
	(16:19:18) iplesoianu: yeha
	(16:19:44) iplesoianu: I could try some POCs for both cases
	(16:20:04) : and lead_id is auto increment?
	(16:20:09) iplesoianu: y
	(16:20:18) : yes
	(16:20:18) : pls
	(16:20:22) : that would be great
	(16:20:40) iplesoianu: but that means I'll probably take one more day at least
	(16:20:51) : yes... thats ok 

+ model PartnerIds and test export
	should be one partner export where partnerId = ?

+ add custom XML type that helps Hibernate map between String <-> PostgreSQL XML
    http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Hibernate_XML_Type
+ see if we can use custom queries with JPA to retrieve data through PostgreSQL XPATH query
